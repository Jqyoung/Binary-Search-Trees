# Binary-Search-Trees

- A project from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees).
- The objective is to construct a balanced binary search tree data structure that is capable of storing, retrieving, deleting and traversing the data.

## What I learned

- Implement the level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order binary search tree traversal algorithms.
- Deepen the understanding and application of recursion.
- The behind-the-veil detailed implementation of a binary search tree data structure.
